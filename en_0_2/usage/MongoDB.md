[MongoDB performance monitor plugin for Open-Falcon](https://github.com/ZhuoRoger/mongomon)
--------------------------------

Supports
------------------

Supported version: v2.4, v2.6, v3.0, v3.2 MongoDB and v3.0 Percona Mongo

Supported storage engine: MMAPv1, wiredTiger, RocksDB, PerconaFT (part of the storage engine has not been tested, which can be added right in the code)

Supported structure: standlone, replica set, sharded cluster

Supported nodeï¼šmongod data node, configuration node,Primary/Secondary, mongos; Arbiter node is NOT supported

The principle of collecting monitor data
---------------
1 survival monitor: auth included

2 serverStatus

3 replSetGetStatus

4 oplog.rs 

5 mongos

They are collected and sent by cron once a minute and the collection will not affect the performance of MongoDB.

Required Environment
---------------
Operation system: Linux

Python 2.6

PyYAML > 3.10

python-requests > 0.11

Mongomon Deployment
-------------------
1 Unzip to /path/to/mongomon. 

2 Configure the multi-instance information of the current server (mongod, nodes,mongos). Each line in /path/to/mongomon/conf/mongomon.conf records a instance in form of: port, username, password

-  {port: 27017, user: "",password: ""}

3 Configure crontab, Change the installation path of mongomon in mongomon/conf/mongomon_cron; cp mongomon_cron /etc/cron.d/ 

4 After several minutes, user can check MongoDB metric in the Dashboard of Open-falcon.

5 Endpoint is hostname by default.
