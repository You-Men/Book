### Dashboard User Management 
```
Dashboard does not create any account including supervisor account by default. Users need to sign up in the webpage.
If you want to have an ultra supervisor account, please create an account whose name is root. (The first account whose name is root will be considered as ultra supervisor.) The ultra supervisor can allocate permissions to normal users.

Tipsï¼šAnyone who can open the page of Dashboard can create an account. So do not forget to disable the signning up feature of Dashboard after use. What you need to do is to change the value of item "signup_disable" to "true" in the API configuration file "cfg.json" then reboot API. When you want to create an account for someone, just recover the configuration and then disbale the item again.
